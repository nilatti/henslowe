ask for help with:

Editing rehearsal is super slow because it's trying to figure out which acts/scenes/fs are available. How to make this faster?

Everything that talks to GCal is slow. Can we make this faster? This is everything that has to do with rehearsals
Make a local cache of people's calendars.
Look for API that lets ask for everyone's info at a time.

Google API login. What do we do with the refresh token? How can I get deeper access to users' calendars? Right now it's working, but hacked together and requires auth every time, as well as stupid settings in GCal itself.-create script (rake task) in application to call from cron tab that would check time stamp for expiration, look up, write a controller ish thing that would refresh. Watch for edge case where refresh token fails man 5 crontab --> manual for cron thing

Sharing--set to share w/theater and stage manager


HTML5 date picker w/formtastic

To do:
set up role-based permissions do it like casting table--automate adding actors upon casting? auditioners vs. actors
ONCE that is done, extract "actor" from everywhere, switch to user.actor? method
figure out how to set up whole rehearsal schedule
rebuild costumer measurement things
create user-specific dashboards
prettyfy everything
Once gcal issues are resolved consider adding performance class (like to schedule performances)
Make cascading dropdowns like this: http://pullmonkey.com/2012/08/11/dynamic-select-boxes-ruby-on-rails-3/
Consider making users only accessible through theaters	
prettify scope order on jobs

Next Item: nest jobs in theaters (in controllers and elsewhere)
