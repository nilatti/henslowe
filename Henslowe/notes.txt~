ask for help with:

Editing rehearsal is super slow because it's trying to figure out which acts/scenes/fs are available. How to make this faster?

Everything that talks to GCal is slow. Can we make this faster? This is everything that has to do with rehearsals

Google API login. What do we do with the refresh token? How can I get deeper access to users' calendars? Right now it's working, but hacked together and requires auth every time, as well as stupid settings in GCal itself.

HTML5 date picker w/formtastic

To do:
set up role-based permissions do it like casting table--automate adding actors upon casting? auditioners vs. actors
figure out how to set up whole rehearsal schedule
rebuild costumer measurement things
create user-specific dashboards
prettyfy everything
Once gcal issues are resolved consider adding performance class
